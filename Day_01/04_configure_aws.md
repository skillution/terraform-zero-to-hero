# Set Up Cloud Account Authentication

*Before Terraform can start spinning up resources in AWS, it needs access to your AWS account. That means setting up AWS credentials and making sure everything is properly configured. Let‚Äôs break it down step by step.*

---

## 1. Install AWS CLI

üëâ Head over to the [AWS CLI download page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and follow the instructions to install AWS CLI

üëâ Follow the installation steps, and once it's done, check if it's working by running:

```cmd
aws --version
```

If you see the version number, you're good to go!

## 2. Create an IAM User

Now, let‚Äôs create a secure user for Terraform to interact with AWS. 

Instead of using your root account, we‚Äôll create an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user with limited permissions.

- Log in to AWS Console: Use an admin account to access the AWS IAM Console. 

- Go to IAM ‚Üí Users ‚Üí Add User 

- Choose a username.

- Assign Permissions:
  For our first configuration, we will create an S3 bucket.
  Let's attach `AmazonS3FullAccess` access policy to our new user.
  Choose `attach policies directly`and search for `AmazonS3FullAccess`. Select the check box against the access policy and click on Next button.

  If you need access to other AWS services, assign relevant permissions.
  Click `Create User` finalize.

- Create User & Save Credentials: AWS will generate an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key‚Äîsave these somewhere safe (like a password manager). You‚Äôll need them in the next step!

## 3. Generate or Retrieve the User‚Äôs Access Keys

Go to the IAM Console: AWS Console > IAM. Select ‚ÄúUsers‚Äù in the left navigation pane.

**Click on the Username** you created. You should see a summary of the user‚Äôs details.

**Click on Create access key:**

**Select the usecase as `Command Line Interface(CLI)`**

**Provide a description(Optional) and click on `Create access key`**

**Download or copy the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.**

Important: If you do not download or copy the keys now, you won‚Äôt be able to retrieve the secret key later.
Note: Each user can have a maximum of two active access keys at once. If you already have two, you must delete one to create a new one.

## 4. Configure AWS CLI Credentials

To set up credentials, use the AWS CLI command 'aws configure'.

```cmd
aws configure
```

You‚Äôll be prompted to enter:

1. AWS Access Key ID
2. AWS Secret Access Key
3. Default region name (e.g., us-east-1)
4. Default output format (leave as None)

```cmd
AWS Access Key ID [****************7WPF]:
AWS Secret Access Key [****************giL/]:
Default region name [us-west-2]:
Default output format [json]:
```
